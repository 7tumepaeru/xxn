## Access and Edit the Library Files
 
The first step to hack Chief Architect libraries is to access and edit the library files. Library files are stored in your computer's hard drive in the following location:
 `C:\Users\Public\Documents\Chief Architect Premier X13 Data\Libraries` 
You can also access them from within Chief Architect by going to **Library > Open Library Folder**.
 
The library files have the extension `.calib` and can be opened with any text editor such as Notepad or WordPad. However, we recommend using a more advanced editor such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text that can handle large files and syntax highlighting.
 
Once you open a library file, you will see something like this:

 ![Library file example](https://i.imgur.com/0Q7XZ8R.png) 
This is the XML code that defines the library content. You can edit this code to change the properties of the symbols, materials, and objects in the library. For example, you can change the name, description, category, dimensions, colors, textures, etc. of any element.
 
However, be careful when editing the library files as any mistake can cause errors or corruption in your library. Make sure you backup your original library files before making any changes. Also, do not edit the `<Version>` tag as this can affect the compatibility of your library with Chief Architect.
  
## Use the Library Browser to Import and Export Symbols
 
The next step to hack Chief Architect libraries is to use the Library Browser to import and export symbols. The Library Browser is a tool that allows you to browse, search, and manage your libraries. You can access it by going to **Library > Library Browser**.

The Library Browser has two panels: the left panel shows the library folders and categories, and the right panel shows the symbols in each category. You can drag and drop symbols from one category to another or from one library to another. You can also right-click on any symbol and select **Edit Symbol** to open the Symbol Specification dialog.
 
The Library Browser also allows you to import and export symbols from other sources. You can import symbols from other Chief Architect libraries or from external files such as `.skp`, `.dwg`, `.dxf`, `.3ds`, `.obj`, etc. To import a symbol, go to **Library > Import Library** or **Library > Import 3D Symbol** and select the file you want to import.
 
You can also export symbols from your library to other formats such as `.skp`, `.dwg`, `.dxf`, `.3ds`, `.obj`, etc. To export a symbol,
